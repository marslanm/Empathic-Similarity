0,Hippocorpus,"June of this year my friends and I decided to road trip from Munich Germany to Croatia. My friends and I had tickets to ultra music fest and decided that a road trip would be the most fun way to go. The ride should have lasted about 9/10 hours give or take. We left the hotel in Germany at around 6 in the morning, we didnt want to drive too late at night because we would have been tired. 

We were on the road for about 5 hours when the car we were in experienced a flat tire. Luckily for my friends and I we all know how to change a tire so we got out the car and went to change the tire but there was no extra tire. We were stuck with no service in the middle of no where. We tried calling the rental car company and tried calling for help but there was no connection. 

My friends and I decided to walk back about 4 miles to where we saw a gas station to call for help. About an hour later we were at the gas station but there was no one there, and we still had no phone service. We decided to stay at the gas station for some time hoping that someone would show up. 

4 hours later with no service and still waiting for help we decided to walk back to the car. 30 minutes after walking towards the car we saw a huge van start to head towards us, we jumped up and down for help and the van stopped and a musician who was playing at the same venue we were going to got out the van with his security. 

My friends and I explained the situation and they gave us a ride to the venue and backstage passes it was amazing. Before we got to the venue we were able to call the rental car company and they tracked the car to pick it up and return it to us. 

The celebrity and my friends and i ended up hanging out all weekend, and becoming great friends. My friends and I were shocked and it was considered the best weekend ever.","June of this year my friends and I decided to road trip from Munich Germany to Croatia.

1,Hippocorpus,"Last March I went to a tax accountant. I needed to file amended returns for the Patreon income from four previous years. I'd been under the impression since I set up my Patreon account that it was gift income, and therefore non-taxable. But gradually it became my primary source of income and I shifted to self-employment as a freelance writer. And the more I looked into it the more I began to suspect it was taxable after all. I feared getting into serious trouble. 

In July of last year I concluded that it was indeed taxable. So I made plans to see an accountant and file for back taxes. According to my research on Google the IRS was required to allow installment payments I could afford, but I was still quite apprehensive in the months leading up to the meeting. 

In March I met with the accountant, gave him documentation of the additional income, and paid him $400 for preparing four years' amended returns. This was considerably cheaper than my worst-case estimate, and was in itself a significant relief. And he confirmed my information about making installment payments. 

In the months since, the IRS sent me a bill for back taxes and I arranged a modest $64/month installment payment. I also subtract 15% self-employment tax. It's a total tax burden I'm able to bear relatively easily, and a great load off my mind.","Last March I went to a tax accountant.

11,Facebook-MIT Confession," Until this year, I've never actually had an advisor/mentor figure who actively cared about my wellbeing or who I felt I could trust with my issues. Yet now thats changed!! This semester is the first time I've ever felt fully supported, even though basically every other aspect of my life has been upended. 

I honestly dont think I could've gotten through it without their support and I'm so grateful to them for actually caring. I hope if I'm ever in the position to mentor someone, im as amazing as them. 

On a darker note though, I feel like since I'm so used to being disregarded, I'm just waiting for the day that they stop caring or start dismissing me. It seems too good to be true, and I'm scared I'll disappoint them. My trust is so tenuous as it is, and I still haven't been able to be fully open with them."," Until this year, I've never actually had an advisor/mentor figure who actively cared about my wellbeing or who I felt I could trust with my issues.

14,Hippocorpus," In the last three to six months, an event that was striking for me was taking my son to an amusement park for the first time. We went to King's Island. My son is five, but large for his age (big enough to go on every ride in the ""Kiddie"" part of the park), but he has a developmental disorder, with issues predominantly centered around attention and language. This has given him some social delays as well - and so often in exciting places (like an amusement park) it can be tough to maintain his attention on something that I want him focused on. 

 

Also, there are times when he doesn't have the language to communicate his needs or express what he's thinking about. Despite this, he's adventurous and likes to try new things, so going to an amusement park is sort of ""up his alley"" but also a type of situation that can give me anxiety due to the language and attention challenges. 

 

This trip was amazing. My son was completely excited and had the time of his life. We had worked on the word ""brave"" and he continued to use this term to describe himself at the park. He'd go up to one of the kiddie rides and express that he was going to be brave and then I'd watch him just rise to the moment. 

 

I'll be honest, I'm getting emotional just remembering the look on his face when he was utterly terrified of a ride, wanted to be on it, and didn't want me to ride it with him. He told me he was going to be ""Brave"" and the determination and maturity as he faced his fear, and handled it was amazing.

15,Reddit-Casual Conversations,"Several weeks ago, my friends asked me if I would give up my job to be a nanny for their children. One of which is special needs. I have worked at my position for 7 years. I love my coworkers. My hours are great. The commute is easy. Salary is generous. I enjoy what I do, although the changes in society post covid have really taken a toll. Being talked down to by a stranger is now a daily thing and as much as you let it slide off your shoulders, it does grate you down each time. 

Several weeks ago, while visiting with our friends and their family, they asked me if I'd be willing to leave my job to become their nanny full time. Their youngest requires several in home therapy sessions each week and that requires a family member to be there because it's in the home and not at a daycare.Because of my relationship with the family, I qualify as being his aunt and can be the point person for therapy. They were willing to pay my current salary plus gas expenses. 

Today I let my supervisor know that October 12 would be my last day. I thought I'd be there until I was ready to retire. I'm still in a little state of shock that I bit the bullet and said yes. I'm excited and honored by my friend's trust that I can keep their precious little dude safe and be reactive to any health emergencies that might come his way. 

I'm hoping it works out for everyone. Leaps of faith are so scary!","Several weeks ago, my friends asked me if I would give up my job to be a nanny for their children. One of which is special needs.

19,Hippocorpus,"About a month ago I returned to doing something that I was very passionate about and loved to do. It had been about five years since I had last been a pool. 

Since I was about 8 years old I had been swimming competitively over the summer at my neighborhood pool, from there I swam for my high school team, and then around the same time I began swimming for a club team. Between morning practices before school and then practices after school as well as the occasional swim meets that took place throughout the week my schedule was booked. I would go to my club practices every Saturday meaning essentially I got one day off every week which was Sunday. 

When the season was up for high school swimming I would go on to continue swimming for my club and then during the summer I would do both club and swim for my neighborhood swim team. Swimming was my life. It was all I had known since I was 8 years old and when I was 18 I had to make the painful choice about whether or not I wanted to continue swimming in college. 

I ended up choosing having a social life over swimming to a lot of people's dismay. Towards the end of my high school career I was emotionally and physically drained and I felt like I just needed a break. So I went on to have a normal college life with no swimming involved. It was difficult. The guilt definitely took a toll on my subconscious. I would have dreams all the time about getting back into the pool and I wondered if I had made a mistake. 

I began to avoid pools at all costs and it wasn't until recently that I decided I was ready to get back into the water. A light that seemed to have dimmed inside of me was now brighter than ever and it just felt right and I've been doing it ever since.","About a month ago I returned to doing something that I was very passionate about and loved to do.

I thought I had ruined it, but I guess there's an automatic circuit breaker that turns back on after it cools down. I did have to clean my microwave thoroughly and let it air out. So just be careful!The main reason to have one is to save time. You don't have to plan things nearly as far ahead.

She realized I made immature decisions and hoped that maybe if we met again in New York, we could get back together again.

57,Hippocorpus,"My grandma in Oregon passed away a couple weeks ago. The process was painful to hear about and it hit me harder than I thought it would. I was very close with my grandma and so was my mom. My mom's siblings put her on Hospice about three weeks ago and within a week she was gone. 

There was a lot of family drama over the passing of her and I did not agree with with how she was taken care of in the end. I feel she was pushed into the direction of death by being heavily medicated and her family members that were there were not getting her up out of bed anymore. I realize people get old and everyone's time comes but I feel like it wasn't her time yet. But you can't go back in time and she's gone now. 

I was able to travel with my parents and sister to Oregon to attend her funeral. It was an emotional roller coaster. The hardest day for me was when the day before her funeral I found out that there had been rules put in place by my Uncle that no grand kids were going to be able to go view my grandma and say goodbye. Because of all the drama, he wanted to hurt everyone he could that wasn't on his side. 

I went to the funeral home with my parents anyway in hopes that I might still get a chance. After arguing with the funeral director, it was decided that I would not be able to go in the room. I was crushed, I was so hurt and upset but I was trying to hold it together for my mom. 

My mom was able to go in for a while and sit with her mom so I waited outside with other family members. After some time, my mom came outside in a hurry and told me to come quickly. I didn't know what had happened but apparently the funeral director had a change of heart and decided to go against the request of my Uncle and let me go view my Grandma. 

Walking in that room was so surreal. I couldn't believe my beloved grandma was laying there in her coffin. I never thought it would bother me as much as it did. I couldn't even bring myself to touch her, I guess I was scared or in denial.

I blame it on my parents. My family is very close-minded. Often times people in my class in middle school would ask me to go play with them and my parents almost always wouldn't let me.
