But gradually it became my primary source of income and I shifted to self-employment as a freelance writer. And the more I looked into it the more I began to suspect it was taxable after all. I feared getting into serious trouble. <br><br>In July of last year I concluded that it was indeed taxable. So I made plans to see an accountant and file for back taxes.

This was considerably cheaper than my worst-case estimate, and was in itself a significant relief.

My son is five, but large for his age (big enough to go on every ride in the ""Kiddie"" part of the park), but he has a developmental disorder, with issues predominantly centered around attention and language. This has given him some social delays as well - and so often in exciting places (like an amusement park) it can be tough to maintain his attention on something that I want him focused on. <br><br> <br><br>Also, there are times when he doesn't have the language to communicate his needs or express what he's thinking about. Despite this, he's adventurous and likes to try new things, so going to an amusement park is sort of ""up his alley"" but also a type of situation that can give me anxiety due to the language and attention challenges. <br><br> <br><br>This trip was amazing. My son was completely excited and had the time of his life. We had worked on the word ""brave"" and he continued to use this term to describe himself at the park.

He clearly misunderstood my intentions and got into a panic, becoming really scared and shouting ""I don't want to ride it!"" He calmed down when my wife explained that she wasn't going to make him get on the big rides. <br><br> <br><br>Although, honestly, he gave me a skeptical look as if to say, ""You won't Mom, but I dunno about Dad....""

It had been about five years since I had last been a pool. <br><br>Since I was about 8 years old I had been swimming competitively over the summer at my neighborhood pool, from there I swam for my high school team, and then around the same time I began swimming for a club team. Between morning practices before school and then practices after school as well as the occasional swim meets that took place throughout the week my schedule was booked. I would go to my club practices every Saturday meaning essentially I got one day off every week which was Sunday. <br><br>When the season was up for high school swimming I would go on to continue swimming for my club and then during the summer I would do both club and swim for my neighborhood swim team. Swimming was my life. It was all I had known since I was 8 years old and when I was 18 I had to make the painful choice about whether or not I wanted to continue swimming in college. <br><br>I ended up choosing having a social life over swimming to a lot of people's dismay. Towards the end of my high school career I was emotionally and physically drained and I felt like I just needed a break. So I went on to have a normal college life with no swimming involved. It was difficult. The guilt definitely took a toll on my subconscious. I would have dreams all the time about getting back into the pool and I wondered if I had made a mistake. <br><br>I began to avoid pools at all costs and it wasn't until recently that I decided I was ready to get back into the water. A light that seemed to have dimmed inside of me was now brighter than ever and it just felt right and I've been doing it ever since.","Well I just turned 34 last week, and I still don't have a clue what I would do if I didn't snowboard. Snowboarding saved my life. I said whatever it is that I do , I wanna have to train for it. Because I wasn't an academic at all, sports was my main thing. <br><br>Along this whole time, I also had this fascination with surfing, which, being from Vancouver, there was no surfing. Then my best friends came home with two snowboards and I'm like perfect. This is exactly what I wanna do, so that's when I kind of started snowboarding and I got really, really addicted to it. <br><br>And then I sort of started switching over to doing this for a living. It was a big risk, but at the same time, I don't really feel comfortable unless I'm pushing the envelope.

I went online to find what others have done in a similar situation and one night, I was driven to confess thinking it would rid my guilty conscience and that if we were to have a successful relationship, it had to start over somehow.

She realized I made immature decisions and hoped that maybe if we met again in New York, we could get back together again. <br><br>On hindsight, maybe she was letting me down easy.

I think about all the homeless people I've seen on the streets, all the beggars I've ever walked past, I think of people in mental hospitals who will never be healthy enough to get out, I think of the homeless teen I met in a downtown mental resource centre, I think of all the drug addicts I've seen shooting up heroin on the transit system, and I just want to cry. <br><br>Why do people have to suffer so much? Why do they suffer more than me? Why is there nothing I can do about it?","

Before that for about a decade I was a prosecutor in the Suffix County District Attorney's Office in Boston. I didn't have any intention of becoming a prosecutor. I wanted to be a public defender. But once I got in I realized the power and opportunity of this degree. It could get you to do different things and help a lot of people. <br><br>The journey to where I'm at now started in a very different place. When I was 19 years old, I got arrested for selling pot. My father was a white police officer. Just by virtue of the fact who my father was, I got out. That was the most unjust thing I've seen. <br><br>My zip code and my parent defined the rest of my life. Every single day, I saw hundreds and hundreds of kids that just didn't have that one little thing in their life. This is just a huge problem, what do we do? <br><br>My answer is, we as people who have the privilege to go and get degrees, we need to fight for those people.","I'm an Attorney with the Innocence Project. Before I was practicing law with the Innocence Project I was actually writing the Innocence Project from a prison cell with a 28 year sentence. I was falsely accused of a rape after going to a college party with two friends when I was 17 years old, just graduating high school. I was in prison for almost ten years, before the Wisconsin Innocence Project answered one of my letters. They argued on my behalf. My conviction was reversed, my record sponged, and I was released in 2007, in February. <br><br>So the thing that I wanted to do was I wanted to be re-acclimated back into society. So I said, okay, I'm gonna go to junior college and I put on the back of my bedroom door my five-year plan. So each and every day, as I opened the door, I would see it. And it would be a reminder of where I wanted to be. <br><br>And that thing is so important to you, it's almost as important to you as taking your next breath. So no matter what, you're gonna either go around it, you're gonna go over it, or you're gonna go right through it, to get to that thing on the other side. That's what you have to do with your career. <br><br>We should never give up and we should never give in to the desires that we have to become whatever it is in life that we wanna be.","
The founder and president of Prosecuter Impact, a former prosecutor in the Suffix County District Attorney's Office in Boston, shares his journey from being arrested for selling pot at 19 to becoming a prosecutor.
