0,Facebook-MIT Confession,"Since I was little I received unwanted attention from many people, from little things, such as some guy showed me his penis before I was 10, to something worse. But there was one particular guy, who would kiss me against my will on many occasions. The first time it happened, I was 12 and I got angry and punched him in the face. Everyone around me said that I overreacted and really nothing was wrong, so since then I never cared when someone kissed me or touched me when I didn't want to. 

Since then I got angry one more time: when I was 14, one guy, whom I was really close with and trusted a lot, held me down for another guy because it was just a game or at least started as a truth or dare. 

This past summer a guy got me drunk to have sex with me. He was holding me down on a bed with the weight of his body, and as I was resisting and asking him to stop, he was just laughing and telling me that I wanted it. The following day I hung out with him and another old high school friends like nothing happened, I guess I became insensitive to whatever people would do to me. 

After coming to college, I for the first time in my life realized that what has been happening before was not the way things are supposed to be. It was the first time here when I learned what word ""consent"" meant. I'm not saying that nothing unwanted can happen to you here, but I'm saying that there are many nice people, whom you can trust, and you can have very positive experiences.","Since I was little I received unwanted attention from many people, from little things, such as some guy showed me his penis before I was 10, to something worse.

2,Facebook-MIT Confession,"After having a pretty rough night where I constantly felt like I was on the verge of passing out, I went to bed and got around two hours of sleep. When I woke up, I felt completely sobered up, but the life circumstances that made me drink so much in the first place kept me awake for the next hour and a half, thinking and thinking. It's so hard to get away from your thoughts sometimes. 

Even though I really felt like I should sleep, I just couldn't, so I ended up getting out of bed, taking a cold shower, and heading on campus at six in the morning. Watching the sun rise on a new day as I made my way toward campus, I felt incredibly at peace despite the chaos that is my life right now. That feeling made me want to cry. 

I wish I could get up everyday early in the morning, feeling motivated to overcome anything that happens to me, but instead there are always days where I stay in bed until my roommate comes back from class, days where I sit in front of my computer with something to do but unable to bring myself to do it, days where I think giving up would be so much easier than fighting. I can't help but notice that most of my days are like that. 

But today is different. Today will be a good day, and I can't say the same for tomorrow or tomorrow's tomorrow or days, weeks, months, and years after that, but knowing that another day will come along where I wake up feeling like things are getting better makes me hope. It makes me hope that someday the balance will change, that I will be happy more often than I am sad, that my thoughts will let me go and let me live, that every difficult experience I have is moving me forward, not holding me back. 

I don’t know that any of this is relatable, and I can’t say that my situation is resolved after today, but I can’t help but marvel at the wonder that is hope. Having hope that things will be better and that life will go on, even when it feels impossible, has given me the strength to take this day in my hands and to make it what I want it to be.

11,Hippocorpus,"Recently I took a trip with my partner, Karl, to an amusement park about an hour east called Kentucky Kingdom. We don't have a ton of money to spend on vacation, so any little trip is a big deal for us. Also we totally suck at planning things, and hadn't done anything all summer, until we really buckled down and started making a cohesive plan. We splurged and got a hotel near the park for two nights, and invited a friend of ours from Tennessee to come stay with us too. His name was Nick, and we'd never met him. 

That is to say, we met him on Twitch. Karl and I started streaming a little over a year ago, and while I got bored of it fairly quickly, he kept at it and ended up starting a small group of streamers. Nick was one of the first members added to the group, all of us fans of the game Dropmix (a strange music/card game hybrid). In the months that followed we would all become closer watching each others stream at different times of the day, keeping each other company at work and so on. So when we invited him to stay with us, we felt like we knew him. 

I would describe myself as having a high degree of social anxiety. I had some hesitation about meeting someone in real life who only knew me from my online persona. But it ended up being awesome! Karl, Nick, and myself all share a love of roller coasters in addition to weird card games, and surprisingly none of us had ever been to Kentucky Kingdom before. 

The lines were short and they offered free soda to visitors from out of town (I won't say no!), the rides were awesome, and the people-watching was on point. The only drawback to the whole thing was that Nick and Karl both snore. But I'd had enough to drink each night that it wasn't much of an issue. 

I ended up feeling glad that we rallied and planned a trip, however quaint. It's something more people should try. Even just a few days away with friends made the stressful reality of day to day life a little more tolerable.","Recently I took a trip with my partner, Karl, to an amusement park about an hour east called Kentucky Kingdom.

Finally got to my second son's school and got inside to find his teachers, get him all signed in and I just made it in time. I said goodbye and felt bad for all the parents whose kids were screaming, crying, hitting because they didn't want to leave their parents or go to school.

21,Hippocorpus,"This happened about a month ago. I was outside with my daughter and she was playing with her friends and trying to learn how to ride a bike. I was looking at the next parking lot over and saw a few young kids riding their scooters and bikes on the side walk but going into the parking lot as well. I couldnt see anyone watching them and people zoom around here in all parking lots. 

I was paying attention to my daughter when i heard a loud thud. I knew instantly what it was. Some young kid in his supped up car smacked into of of the girls. I called 911 as i was running over the kid didnt even get out of the car. 

I stood behind him while talking to the operator in attempts to not let him leave. The kid was screaming, i think she broke her arm, and the mom finally makes her way outside. Shes with her kid screaming as im talking and waiting. 

The cops show up a few minutes later before the ambulance and take over. It was crazy but the girl in the end ive seen in a cast. It could have went a lot worse.

I brought my mother home for hospice so I could be with her to the end. I prayed to God as I watched her terrible sufferings, it seemed like she could go at any moment, however, she was trying hard to stay alive until my birthday. 

It was the most important day of her life and she wanted to be there for me. She lived to see the day, even though she could hardly master any strength, she even signed my birthday card with three simple and yet most powerful words: "" I love you!"". I cried as I held her in my arms. 

She feel asleep shortly after giving me my card and watching me blow the candles on the cake that my husband brought into her room. She soon slipped into a coma and took her final breath the next morning while I held her hand.

37,Hippocorpus,"I am pregnant, and with that has come all sorts of thrills and fears. Overall, things have been going smoothly, but I am still prone to worry that something might be amiss with the baby. This is particularly due to the fact that it is difficult to know what is going on inside, especially in the early months. As my pregnancy progressed, I was eagerly waiting for the moment when I would begin to feel the baby move. This didn't happen as early as something of the books indicated it might, which lead to worry. Eventually, though, I began to feel fluttering movements that seemed different from other sensations I had experienced. 

I became fairly confident these movements were the baby, but it was still easy to doubt myself. Two weeks of this mix of confidence and doubt was relieved one night, though. I felt some kicks (at least what I hoped were kicks), and I encourage my husband to feel my belly. It was doubtful if he could feel anything yet, as the doctor indicated it might be awhile before anyone else could sense movement, but he felt something. 

In that moment, his face lit up with excitement, especially as the baby kept kicking, affirming what he was feeling. He held up a finger every time he felt something, and I confirmed that I felt movement simultaneously. It was an incredibly joyful moment for us. It left us feeling close and connected, both with each other, and with the baby. Additionally, it made me feel safe and secure knowing that the movement I had been feeling wasn't entirely in my own head.

Two weeks of this mix of confidence and doubt was relieved one night, though. I felt some kicks (at least what I hoped were kicks), and I encourage my husband to feel my belly. It was doubtful if he could feel anything yet, as the doctor indicated it might be awhile before anyone else could sense movement, but he felt something. <br><br>In that moment, his face lit up with excitement, especially as the baby kept kicking, affirming what he was feeling. He held up a finger every time he felt something, and I confirmed that I felt movement simultaneously. It was an incredibly joyful moment for us. It left us feeling close and connected, both with each other, and with the baby. Additionally, it made me feel safe and secure knowing that the movement I had been feeling wasn't entirely in my own head. <br><br>This was a beautiful moment in our relationship and in my pregnancy.","The author is pregnant and worried about the health of their baby, especially as it is difficult to know what is happening inside.

When he was in the hospital they found two spots on his lung. When he was first admitted to the hospital he was spitting up some blood but everyone thought it was because of the pneumonia. 

While he was at the hospital the bleeding got much worse. He started spitting up so much blood that the white wash rags at the hospital were completely red. We knew that he had one spot on his lung that the doctors were following, but the second spot came as a surprise. He was never officially diagnosed with lung cancer but we know that is what he had. 

The bleeding got so bad that they had to give him a suction hose to keep it cleared out. He got to where he could not breath at all and his oxygen was turned up as high as it would go. He never wanted to be put on life support so the family just stayed by his side as all the machines were turned off and he drew his last breath. 

I was devastated having to watch someone that was so strong and loved life so much take his last breath. My uncle was my last living relative other than cousins. He was our family elder. I grew up with him and my aunt being just right down the road from me for over 30 years.

43,Hippocorpus,"Over the Memorial Day holiday in the United States, my family of 12 and I went on a family vacation. We rented a huge log cabin in the mountains that included pin ball machines, old school video games, a pool table, swimming pool, hot tub, and large enough areas that all of us could sit around and talk. 

This vacation was especially memorable because my parents who are in their 70's, were able to spend time with all 5 of their grandchildren, son-in-law, nephew, married in relatives, and myself, their oldest daughter. We spent a lot of time laughing and cooking together. We would sit out on the balcony and look at the breathtaking views. We were very high up on the mountain and the drive up was pretty scary at times, LOL, yet that provided us with a lot of pictures and memories that will last forever. 

There were a few times that we went into the city to shop, go out to eat, and explore what the Smokey Mountains had to offer. One evening we went to a new area where there is a huge farris wheel. While I personally would not go on it, several of my family members did, and when they were at the top they took awesome pictures. My nephew said, holy crap, that thing is tall. The way he said it was so funny. He is a little guy so seeing him look at the farris wheel and understand the height of it was cool. 

Every morning my husband and son-in-law would go fishing. One day they brought back Trout. After they cleaned the fish my son-in-law put it on the grill and cooked it for anyone who wanted some. The first batch of fish was excellent and everyone ate it. By this time everyone was full. He still had one more fish that he had to cook. As I was eating this fish I noticed that it didn't entirely look done. I picked at it a few more times. 

That evening we all sat around the cabin talking and playing games. We had our telescope there so we were able to look at the stars at night and find the constellations. 

After everyone went to bed, I woke up around midnight thinking I was dying. Nope, FOOD POISONING!!! While it was not funny at the time because I was literally thinking that I was dying, I look back now and laugh because everyone talks about me getting food poisoning and the shape that I was in.

It was a great honer to do his eulogy and cover the wonderful accomplishments of such a great man that I have looked up to my entire life. All of my family were in attendance, which was a great thing as most of us haven't seen one another in many years. My grandfather always cared about family and made family the point and purpose of his life. Unfortunately, it required his passing to remind us of the that value. He fathered six children and had 9 grandchildren and 7 great grandchildren and they were all in attendance to honor his home going! 

Just two years before, in the same month I did my father's funeral and everyone was in attendance there as well. I mention this because at my grandfather's funeral the place was packed, save one empty chair. It was a touching thought that there was one chair left in honor of my father. I mentioned this in the eulogy and hoped that all in the family who know that there is a chair in our home and at the table for every one of them! 

During the funeral I preached a message as well on the lives that are lived as an anchor for others. My Grandfather was most certainly an anchor for all of us as well as grandpa and grandmas house was an anchor for our souls when traveling into town. I also expressed how our faith anchors us in the decisions that we make in life. That many time we can drift too far off course and that life has a way of blowing from our course through storms. Although the winds of life are experienced by everyone, we do not have to allow them to shipwreck us or our faith. Through faith and trust we hold on and are anchored to the rock!

I am glad that my family trusted me to minister to all in this trying time. I was very humbled and honored to do it.","Just this past Wednesday on August the 21st I performed my Grandfathers funeral.

48,Hippocorpus,"A week ago, I was having pain in my back. I thought it was just normal wear and tear until the pain got worse in the afternoon. It was so sharp and felt like something was squeezing on my insides. It no longer seemed like it was routine back pain so I decided to go to the emergency room. It took forever for someone to see me, and I was worried because the pain continued. 

A nurse came in to see me, asked what my symptoms were, and then told me I would need to undergo some tests. I waited some more hours before the big scanning machine was available. The scan was painless, and after I was done, I went to use the bathroom since I was told the doctor would come talk to me soon. 

I immediately felt the pain disappear after using the bathroom. When I was waiting for the doctor, a nurse came in the room and told me the doctor would be in shortly, she was just on the phone with the radiologist. I immediately felt panic set in. Why would she be talking to a radiologist? I thought the worst and believed that I must have had something very seriously wrong with me. I started to think of all of the things I was going to miss out in life, and felt extremely sad and hopeless. 

When the doctor arrived, she didn't have a gloomy expression on her face, so I felt hopeful. She said that I had kidney stones. I immediately felt better, even though kidney stones are serious. I didn't know that radiologists look over all the scans the machine does. I thought they only got involved if it was a very serious disease. 

I told her that I felt better after using the bathroom, and she said that it was possible I already passed the kidney stone. Just to be sure, she gave me medications to shrink any stones and to help heal quicker. I was so relieved after that. I felt like I had a new lease on life, and decided to commit myself to eating healthier and drinking much more water.","A week ago, I was having pain in my back.

49,Hippocorpus,"After two attempts at taking the law school admissions test, I had received a respectable score. I took several weeks to craft a personal statement to send to three law schools. I waited until the last possible day, of each law school's admission cycle, to submit my applications.

She called me into the room, telling me she had to show me something. I was expecting it to be a funny picture of our cat, or a video she found that I would be interested in.

This was all stuff that would have normally been so boring, but it wasn't. It was for our baby, so we were having fun even figuring out insurance things.

54,Hippocorpus,"A recent memorable event in my life was when I was surprised to be invited to Disney World by my mother in law. She said she would pay for everything and basically all I had to do was show up. She was meeting her daughter and granddaughter there and had enough money that I could come too. 

I almost didn't go because Disney World is crowded and it can be hard to hang out with a four year but I had not seen that part of the family in awhile, my schedule was clear, and it had been 12 years since I had been to Disney World. So I decided to go. 

My favorite days were when it was just my mother in law and I and we went to Harry Potter at Universal. The theme park was so well done and the rides were really fun and the butter beer was really good. The main big ride I ended up going by myself because my mother in law didn't want to go. It was kind of scary but it was really fun and so well done with 3D effects and lighting. It was too crowded to go wand shopping but that is okay because my husband got me a wand previously when he was in Orlando for a work trip.

We also had fun with my niece, she liked anything to do with Frozen. We had lots of good food, rode on some fun rides. I liked eating at the dinosaur theme restaurant. It was basically Rainforest Cafe but with dinosaurs. 

The hotel we stayed in was Little Mermaid theme so that was really cute. But it was kind of noisy and the buses were far away for our hotel. 

Overall it was a really fun trip and I am glad I went, but I would not be going back any time soon.

58,Hippocorpus,"I'm feeling lost. Back in May I received the news that I was once again being dismissed from the nursing program at Randolph Community College. After putting in sweat, tears and many countless hours I was angry more than anything when I heard the words, ""unfortunately, we cannot let you continue into the program."" I've had time to process my emotions and cry about it, but even now I still feel angry. 

But why? Because I gave it my all and the instructors led myself and other students to believe that they would help us pass. I'm not angry at myself, I'm angry at the director, I'm angry at the instructors and more importantly, I'm angry at the college. 

I understand that I got dismissed the first time because I didn't study enough. But this time? This is on them. More importantly, I'm feeling frustrated. When I try to explain this to my dad, he always takes the college's side and says, ""well you knew what you were in for, didn't you?"" 

Yeah, I knew what I was in for, but that doesn't justify falsely leading students to believe they are ""safe"" and that we will receive help. 

I try and remind myself that this is now in the past and there's no going back. All I can do is learn from the experience and continue to move forward.

My husband and I went with my brother, sister-in-law, their nineteen month old, and our two kids, who are 15 months and 3. It was QUITE an experience.

I was nervous about this trip because it was our first family vacation and I have a hard time managing my two strong-willed children, especially when they are together.

We engaged in a variety of activities including souvenir shopping, visiting the community pool, going to the beach, and watching a bottlenose dolphin show at an aquarium.

Although it was hard to keep both kids organized and happy, it was a memorable experience and one that I'll not soon forget.

63,Hippocorpus,"I was driving in a wealthy Southern California town when my back right tire blew out. I had just attended a lecture at the time, and I found the content extremely emotionally draining, so I wasn't in an excellent mood to begin with. The location where my tire blew out was congested with heavy rush hour traffic; my car broke down next to a sidewalk that was labeled ""no stopping any time."" Many cars honked at me despite my obvious predicament. 

A woman in a giant black Mercedes halted everyone behind her to shout at me from her window; she had a thick Kardashian accent and a Starbucks cup in her hand as she called, ""The sign says NO STOPPING ANY TIME."" I rushed to replace the tire, but I am a very small, not particularly strong person, so it was a slow going process. 

An older man in ragged clothes who smelled heavily of dirt and sweat approached me. My stomach dropped with dread. While I am generally not a cruel person and welcome interactions with people in unfortunate situations, being stuck as I was in ninety degree heat with drivers around me shouting angrily and honking, I wasn't in the most convenient position to help anyone. I didn't have any cash with me to give him, and I didn't know if I could handle a heart-wrenching conversation about how horrendous life can be or learning about the man's visions from God, if he had them. It wasn't kind of me, and in retrospect I am not proud of my feelings when he first approached. 

My anxieties were unfounded, and unfair. The man said nothing to me. He bent down beside my ruined tire, and began removing it from the car. I have never been so moved by anything in my life. A person who I had unfairly feared, a man who was so much less fortunate than every luxury-vehicle driving heckler that drove by, was the only person who stopped to help me change my tire. There were tears in my eyes when I thanked him. 

We talked for a little while; he'd been a teacher once. He didn't go into specifics about his current situation. I offered to take him to dinner, but he refused. He told me to drive safely, and then he walked away. I'm convinced this man was some kind of guardian angel. I'm so grateful to him.","I was driving in a wealthy Southern California town when my back right tire blew out.

The location where my tire blew out was congested with heavy rush hour traffic; my car broke down next to a sidewalk that was labeled ""no stopping any time."" Many cars honked at me despite my obvious predicament. <br><br>A woman in a giant black Mercedes halted everyone behind her to shout at me from her window; she had a thick Kardashian accent and a Starbucks cup in her hand as she called, ""The sign says NO STOPPING ANY TIME."" I rushed to replace the tire, but I am a very small, not particularly strong person, so it was a slow going process. <br><br>An older man in ragged clothes who smelled heavily of dirt and sweat approached me. My stomach dropped with dread. While I am generally not a cruel person and welcome interactions with people in unfortunate situations, being stuck as I was in ninety degree heat with drivers around me shouting angrily and honking, I wasn't in the most convenient position to help anyone. I didn't have any cash with me to give him, and I didn't know if I could handle a heart-wrenching conversation about how horrendous life can be or learning about the man's visions from God, if he had them. It wasn't kind of me, and in retrospect I am not proud of my feelings when he first approached. <br><br>My anxieties were unfounded, and unfair. The man said nothing to me. He bent down beside my ruined tire, and began removing it from the car. I have never been so moved by anything in my life. A person who I had unfairly feared, a man who was so much less fortunate than every luxury-vehicle driving heckler that drove by, was the only person who stopped to help me change my tire. There were tears in my eyes when I thanked him. <br><br>We talked for a little while; he'd been a teacher once. He didn't go into specifics about his current situation. I offered to take him to dinner, but he refused. He told me to drive safely, and then he walked away. I'm convinced this man was some kind of guardian angel. I'm so grateful to him.","The protagonist's tire blew out in traffic in a wealthy Southern California town, causing many cars to honk at them, including a woman in a black Mercedes who yelled at them.

64,Hippocorpus,"One night in June, I went to the gym to burn off some excess energy and clear my head so I'd fall asleep more easily. I came home from the movies to find my mother sitting on the sofa with a glass of wine on the coffee table, watching TV. She asked me how the gym was, as if that's something that she'd understand since she's the laziest person I know when it comes to exercise, and she sounded a little drunk. I could also smell wine from 10 feet away in the kitchen, and noticed an empty bottle on the counter. She'd drank the entire thing during the time before I left and while I was gone. 

She tried to ask me about my day when I realized she was totally drunk. Despite feeling great about having just worked out, my mood immediately shifted from being slightly annoyed about her having happy hour while I was away to livid about her being wasted for no apparent reason. I told her not to talk to me and she asked why; I briefly considered walking away from the situation. 

The anger welled up in me and I knew I had to give her a piece of my mind about what had become a disturbing habit of alcohol abuse. I raised my voice and told her it didn't matter how my day was, because she ruined it by getting excessively intoxicated when she knew it was something that greatly upset. She looked at me with an expression of confusion and sloppily said she was sorry. I yelled at her that she wasn't sorry because she kept behaving that way even though she knew how much it upset me, and it was better not to lie. 

I told her she was a selfish person and she had a problem, and if she was going to be a liar, she should learn to do a better job of it or just not talk to me at all. I grabbed my laptop and stormed out of the room, exiting to my bedroom. 

I went into my adjoining bathroom, slamming the door open so hard that it knocked the towel rack through the drywall.

We got out of my car to assess the damage and make sure the other driver was okay. The other driver got out of their car and was obviously under the influence.

I was concerned of how I would pay for a visit but I knew something was wrong. It was almost like I could feel death approaching me. 

When I came into the emergency department, I was immediately triaged and when the doctor examined me, his first words to the nurse was, ""Book an OR, stat!"". That was scary but at that point I was a the mercy of the physicians. I prayed to God, asking for his protection. Ten minutes later, I was under anesthesia, grasping at life. 

The initial surgery took 2 hours and the second surgery took 11 hours. In recovery, the doctor explained to me that I had to be opened up and fixed. My gallbladder had gall stones and those gall stones had acted like bullets inside my body when my gallbladder had burst open. The gallstones tore through my pancreas, liver, and right kidney. They had to go in and do some repairs. 

While the ordeal was traumatic and scary, it is a constant reminder that in a blink of an eye, I could have been 6 feet under right now. I am thankful I went to the hospital when I did. I am still unsure how to pay for the $800,000 bill, but I suppose that is the cost of my life.

75,Hippocorpus,"My wife has been trying to convince me to start streaming on Twitch and I finally took the plunge a few months ago.

It was at this moment that I realized that maybe I actually could make streaming into something. Apparently people like to watch me once they discover me and find my brand of humor amusing. 

My wife is currently my only moderator but this also means she's watching my streams when I'm playing and we've grown closer because of the sheer amount of stupid twitch chat/streaming involves.

They had both lived but their father had gotten paralyzed.

I'd never thought that doing something as silly as playing video-games and just talking with random people in my chat could help. I'm glad to find out I was mistaken though and even if it's just a guy and his father I'm happy to say it at least helped two people. 

My wife however is living the ""I told you so"" dream at this point and keeps rubbing in that I should have started sooner.

76,Hippocorpus,"This event happened about two months back. I work from home so my home computer is my life line. Without it I simply couldn't get paid. 

Anyway two months ago my CPU suddenly just died. At first I had no idea what had went wrong, but apparently the cooling gel used to keep the CPU under extreme temps had mostly evaporated, so the CPU was overheating during my late night gaming sessions. 

At the point in time I didn't have enough money to buy a better CPU, I had just finished paying off a bunch of debt that I collected over the years. I pretty much thought I was screwed and maybe had to go out and get a temp job until I had enough money to replace my broken CPU. 

Anyway I had told my mom about it and I guess she told the family because a few days later my mom came over and handed me an envelope of money. At first I thought it was from her and I declined it, I didn't want to take my mother's hard earned money she got from working all those years. 

But she informed me a few of my brothers and sisters got together and pooled in money, enough that I could replace my CPU with a brand new powerful one. I'm not much of an emotional guy, at least in front of others. I try to always keep my cool and play it straight, but I couldn't help as the tears started to fall from my eyes.

77,Hippocorpus,"I recently went on a swimming trip with a group of friends. It was after a Sunday religious service we are all a part of on a hot summer day. We all arranged together how we would get there and where we were going. We drove in three separate cars. We arrived at an area of a river where there was a canal that had deep and slow moving water. 

It was a short walk to the area, and we had to climb down a rocky ledge to reach it. I decided to go in fast while the others were tentative because of the cold water. When getting in, I scraped my arm on the rock I was holding while lowering myself. It made me feel rather clumsy and then I started worrying about if it might get infected. I didn't make a big deal of it because I didn't want to ruin anyone else's time. 

We all swam for a little while, then gathered in a shallow area and just sat and talked for a while. At one point I decided to get up and explore some of the rocky area around the swimming hole. Being with the group was reminding me of times as a kid when I went swimming in these kinds of places with friends. It was making me sad that I don't do it that often anymore.

85,Hippocorpus," About two weeks ago, my boyfriend's grandmother passed away. Her critical health condition did not surprise anyone as her health had been declining for months. On top of that she had dementia from mid stage Alzheimer's so she really didn't remember much of anything.

They needed to operate on her. However, they knew that she probably wouldn't survive the surgery due to her fragile condition. They told us that she probably wouldn't live much longer. We should expect the worst. They fed her a steady supply of pain medications while we watched unable to do anything. 

My boyfriend, his family, and myself returned home to think about what happened. At four in the morning they called us to inform us that her heartbeat was getting fainter. We should return to the hospital if we wanted to say goodbye. So we all left gathering around her. As we said our goodbyes, she passed away. We all stood around crying. My boyfriend's uncle would be arriving shortly to check up on us. We went home afterwards and sat in silence. 

I found the whole thing depressing. Everyone else seemed to take it better than me. They told me that the person they knew and loved died a long time ago. She would continue to decline due to her dementia. At least she was able to pass before she progressed into late stage Alzheimer's.

90,Hippocorpus,"On July 9, 2019 I moving in with my Celia. This is kinda weird, because this is the first time I have ever moved in with a partner. I have had partners where we would spend 10 straight nights together, but we never reached the point where we had a dresser or permanent spot for clothes/ accessories. Walking through the door was such a rush of excitement and washing away of nerves to see the place I will be living in finally. 

It is crazy to be moving all the way across the country to chase down a relationship, but this is a crazy amazing opportunity. I'm so grateful that I decided to go off and take this risk as well as my parents supporting it. Their contribution to make this happen really makes it all possible. The sadness of really having my friends and family so far gone, is at least now not present, because of my focus on the now. 

It's so reassuring to see Celia's perkiness and hear the positivity in her voice. It is such a reaffirmation of the decision to watch her show me her place that she has shown me so much before but only through her phone. It is midday and it is hot up here. That doesn't get in the way of just pressing her body so tightly to the side of mine as she talks about each room. The heat is like melting us together and I feel that close to her. Just energy of joy is bounding through my body. 

Each part of the tour is revealing a part of my future, however long or short it is. As the day goes on, I still feel like a guest in the house, but that feeling is slowly riding away.

This is kinda weird, because this is the first time I have ever moved in with a partner. I have had partners where we would spend 10 straight nights together, but we never reached the point where we had a dresser or permanent spot for clothes/ accessories. Walking through the door was such a rush of excitement and washing away of nerves to see the place I will be living in finally. <br><br>It is crazy to be moving all the way across the country to chase down a relationship, but this is a crazy amazing opportunity. I'm so grateful that I decided to go off and take this risk as well as my parents supporting it. Their contribution to make this happen really makes it all possible. The sadness of really having my friends and family so far gone, is at least now not present, because of my focus on the now. <br><br>It's so reassuring to see Celia's perkiness and hear the positivity in her voice. It is such a reaffirmation of the decision to watch her show me her place that she has shown me so much before but only through her phone. It is midday and it is hot up here. That doesn't get in the way of just pressing her body so tightly to the side of mine as she talks about each room. The heat is like melting us together and I feel that close to her. Just energy of joy is bounding through my body. <br><br>Each part of the tour is revealing a part of my future, however long or short it is. As the day goes on, I still feel like a guest in the house, but that feeling is slowly riding away. Celia prepared a wonderful salad for us for dinner, which is just not her thing.

95,Hippocorpus,"On August 19, 2019, I went to see my new neurologist concerning my MS. I have had MS for many years but over the last 10 years or so, I moved from relapsing remitting to secondary progressive. I have been having a lot of problems with falling and stumbling and the fatigue has been horrible. To further complicate the issue I fell on April 2nd this year and tore up my knee, which exacerbated the MS. 

I started back to work the first day of school, August 14th. I substitute in high needs SPED. I knew I wasn't doing well with my MS, but it came as a complete shock to me when my doctor told me I was ""running out of reserves/ basically about out of reserves"" and I need to conserve my energy NOW. 

She said I should not be working, which I love my students, but she understood why I continued. Now, I am having to cut back my days at school and have accepted the fact that this year will be last year of teaching, I want to use my energy for doing the other things I love, which is travelling. I am going to Italy in September and will have to go on a rollator/wheelchair. 

I am devastated, I have been bursting into tears, even at school, I am having problems coping with this new news. It's almost like when I was first diagnosed, but worse now because of my age. I have always ""pushed through"" and tried to exercise my legs. I have been told I should really STOP now to reserve whatever I have left. 

I am using my walker at home now, so that is helping with my falling. However, because I used to be paralyzed from my waist down and spent years on my scooter, I do not want to have to use a scooter again. I donated both of mine. I also had hand controls in my vehicle, which I am afraid I might have to do again. I am okay with that aid. 

I simply feel like I am going backwards, even though I have known for the 34 years I've had MS it is a progressive disease. Now that my husband is retired and we can do things, it is so difficult for me, though I thoroughly enjoy travelling.

The new neighbors put up a religious sign, from the local hate church. You know, the kind of church that goes to gay pride with signs that say, 'god hates fags,' or picket planned parenthood with fetus photos and angry shouting. 

The new neighbors' son also practice with weapons on the lawn with his buddies, some kind of asian battle sticks, nunchucks, that kind of thing. It's a bunch of white men in their early 20's dressed in black almost every evening, using weapons. 

I am lesbian and not the only gay on the street. I felt more than a little threatened. Some neighbors stopped by to check in with me and let me know I could come by if I felt unsafe. Two houses left phone numbers. 

After the new folks put up their sign from the hate church, new signs started popping up all over the neighborhood. It is a sign based on a US flag with lines of colored print. One line says, 'all are welcome here.' Another line says, ""diversity makes us strong. ' Another says, 'black lives matter.' Basically liberal, loving and inclusive statements and rally cries as befits most residents in this liberal university town. 

I felt very supported, as an individual, as a member of the neighborhood and as a member of a group often targeted for the way we were born.

Fortunately, she told me and I was really mad because I was being betrayed by someone I trusted. I forgave him in my heart but I can't be friends with him anymore. I just can't bring myself to trusting him and considering him my friend anymore. 

What's sad is that he's put my life out of balance now because I don't trust anyone anymore because of that betrayal. That being said, I was happy that my fiancee trusted me enough to alert me about it and get my side before believing anything that friend was telling her. I appreciate her now more than ever and know that whatever life throws at us we'll get through it if we trust each other enough to communicate about everything, good or bad. 

This event helped me learn a few important lessons. One is that we get betrayed by the people we trust most. Second is that communication is key to success in a relationship.","I recently found out that one of my best friends was badmouthing me to my fiancee because he had a thing for her.

During this September we've started hanging out a lot more. Most of the time that we hang out we smoke weed and go on walks, we also have deep and meaningful conversations all of the time. I've been at her house two times and she has been at my house once. We have so much fun together and her smile feels like rays of sun spreading happiness inside of me. 

She has told me how much she enjoys spending time with me compared to other people, when I asked her what she meant with that she didn't really expand on it. Our personalities go together perfectly and I really enjoy spending time with her.

So it sounds like a great story, but now that it's wrapping up I've stepped back and have seen with fresh eyes all the things I didn't do well, or things I didn't do at all - it's so strange how I didn't see it at the time - a kind of work/family blur that I can't explain.

Although I was being partially compensated at the end, I had my own clients to deal with, and after I tried to get several other freelancers on board and it didn't work out, I just did what I could with what time I had. But with the pandemic the whole thing exploded at the same time that I went through two extremely tragic personal losses, and in hindsight I should have just delegated tasks and let the business flourish and should have been less protective.

I'm still a university student while most of my friends have graduated and are working full-time. I'm paying for my own tuition and trying to get a Master degree (those aren't cheap). My waitress salary isn't the best but it covers the basic necessities with a little bit to put into savings. 

My friend would usually invite to me to go out in fancy and expensive places, which I could afford once or twice but not very often. Unfortunately, sometimes I couldn't find an excuse to get out and went with it and everytime it left me drained and more stressed afterwards due to the amount of money I have wasted. 

But ever since I started my new course I've had quite a tight budget so I try to save as much as I could. I'm not struggling to make ends meet but I still need to be smart with money in order to make it through university. So I would decline those hangouts and stated my intentions early on that I can't afford it.

They were obviously a scammer, but I was bored and decided I wanted to have a chat with the scammer so I pretended to fall for it and entered a video call with them.

When they revealed themselves they decided to threaten to show it to everyone I follow (Which is fine by mean since I doubt any of them would care all too much, and maybe even find it funny), unless I gave them 7000.

After that, I proceded to give them tips on how to scam more convincingly, and then said I'd pay them 100 for photos of them. During this, he got increasingly angry and kept screaming until he left without making more attempts to get money. 

Overall it was pretty funny and seemed mostly risk-free, I have no idea if they followed up on the threats yet though.","Today an Instagram scammer pretending to be someone else decided to target me.

Doesn't sound bad at all until I remembered that the school staff told us way back in August (when the last semester ended) that the new semester wouldn't begin until November, and that we'd go to school as normal. 

After reading this I was terrified, like full on panicked. I began refreshing the facebook page where I received the news over and over again, went to recheck my emails multiple time, digging up old notifications to see if there were any mistakes. There weren't so I went back and saw that our class was full of students, and then it clicked. 

You see, the reason I had to wait for a few months to continued studying in the first place was because too many people had dropped out of my class, and the school had to close it until more people has joined. The moment we had enough students for the class again, they reopened it and didn't inform anyone until the very last minute.

134,Reddit-Casual Conversations,"I was at the checkout this morning, waiting behind a mom and her 4/5 year old daughter. She had a cart full of Halloween decorations. Cutesy things like plush pumpkins and wreaths and scarecrows. The mom was at the end of the counter sorting out her reusable shopping bags. 

The child was unloading the cart. She was just jumping with excitement. The level in the cart got so low that the kid couldn't reach over the edge. So she did what any kid would do. She climbed the side. The cart started to tip, so I reached out to steady it. 

I guess Mom caught my movement out of the corner of her eye, because she whipped around, grabbed the kid, and started scolding her. Which, understandable. I startled her and her kid scared her. She stands the kid on the ground and starts emptying the cart. 

And this is where it starts to go off the rails.....The kid is watching with such a look of longing on her face. It was pitiful. The mom completely ignores her. Like she's not even there. Now, me. I would've done one of two or three things. I would've braced that cart with my feet and invited her to climb on up and have at it. Or picked the kid up and put her in the cart so she could hand things out. Or, at the very least, handed the things from the cart to the kid to put on the counter. 

So, when the mom turns towards the cashier, the kid starts climbing the cart again. Mom catches her again and scolds more harshly. Now the kid is standing there, staring at the floor, trying not to cry. Mom is doing the ignoring thing again. I'm trying not to notice. 

Then, the thing that absolutely burned my bacon...Last thing mom picked up out of the cart is this gorgeous child's Halloween mask. It's got fake painted lashes and adorable makeup and is trimmed around the edges with fluffy little feathers. Mom holds it in her hand, looks at the kid and says, ""You didn't really want this anyway, did you?"" In this bored, mean girl kind of voice.

And you happening to add at the end how she stole candy, like youre trying to make her look worse, IF that happened too then the mother might have been out of money and couldnt buy the mask and got a candy bar to give the child in the car to make her feel better. Does it make it right? No. But again, whole lot of judgment for what sounds like a tired parent in a rough place and a child whos not listening that you as an outsider looking in as an abused child now '}, {'score': '1', 'created_utc': '2022-09-29', 'submission_id': 'xqmxp3', 'body': ""I have 2 small kids. I can *almost* guarantee you that the mother's reaction was a culmination of things **ending** with the kid hanging off the side of the cart and not an immediate reaction to that particular action. Sometimes you're trying to do something fun and nice for/with your kid and they're being awful the whole time. At that point, you have to face the fact that the 'fun' and 'nice' thing you're doing was probably more for you than them. It's something you were hoping they would enjoy, but they're clearly not, and they're making you not enjoy it as well. She probably wanted to have 'fun' decorating and doing some cute things with her kid and her kid was sending some obvious signs of not really caring throughout the whole trip, culminating in some 'final straw' thing that you witnessed (probably some conversation about not climbing the cart that had been repeated 12 times before this point). Still, young kids don't like things being taken away. Even if the child was whining and hated everything up until that moment, they would most likely be sad finding out that these things they didn't even care for were being taken away.Honestly, this is one of the worst parts of being a parent: knowing how many super judgemental people are out there who see you doing something other than being an awestruck selfless ball of joy around your child and assume you're an awful human being for it. I think this is a general problem in our society. On top of the pressure of actually trying to raise a decent human, you know that every exasperated sigh or moment of showing that you're a human that occasionally gets frustrated is being turned into judgement soup by someone out there.""}, {'score': '1', 'created_utc': '2022-09-29', 'submission_id': 'xqmxp3', 'body': ""Hey there, u/rusty0123 this submission has been removed because: **Dont post to vent, complain, or express sadness**  Stay positive.

I went to the local humane society the other day to check out a dog. I brought along my kid to make sure they were compatible and comfortable with each other. The dog I was originally looking at was way too timid and not comfortable so they brought out a different one that fit our household needs, as we also have a cat. It went great! The dog and kid got along. The dog was timid at first but warmed up after like 2 minutes and the kid knows how to approach and pet gently as we've been training with her since she was 6 months. 

They said they couldn't release her just yet and to come back 2 days (today) from now. I wanted to have my partner meet the dog first so it fit well in our schedule anyway. When we got to the shelter the same person was working and took us to a different room. We waited for about 10 minutes until she came back and said there was a problem. 

They had received 2 anonymous calls saying we weren't in the right place to adopt an animal. No name or anything left so they don't know who it was. They apologized profusely and said they couldn't give us the dog, but that there was no other red flags and they didn't get a bad vibe from us. They said they would email their manager to reconsider but they likely won't hear back until tomorrow. 

We've had smear campaigns against us because of our activism, mostly calling us groomers, and I've been afraid they would call cps on us but I never expected them to call the humane society. I'm just totally baffled and deflated. We likely will be able to adopt the dog, but the fact someone would call to prevent it, I can't believe it.

146,Reddit-Casual Conversations,"I joined in 2013 right outta high school and left literally 2 days ago. The Army sucked, in fact it sucked a lot. I was initially an 88M but then reclassed to 25Q in 2017 and then did basically nothing. 

I got a lot of stupid stories I can share, but the basic thing is it just feels weird this chapter of my life is over and done with. Also, despite how much it sucked, I don't regret it. I met a ton of awesome people I otherwise wouldn't have, got to go to both Japan and South Korea, and got two degrees - English and Communications - for free. 

My dad tried to talk me into staying for the full 20, but I was just done with it all. I was so tired with it all. On my final final day, I was scheduled for a PT test and decided to take it really just for old times sake and to say goodbye to everyone another time and just chat. 

It was honestly nice to get to say goodbye to everyone again and plus I got a good score on this final PT test that doesn't mean anything lol. I was literally not in the Army anymore on the day I took it which was kinda funny. 

Sad a part is over, but happy as a new chapter in my life is starting. I look forward to what comes next.","I joined in 2013 right outta high school and left literally 2 days ago.

I'm sure it comes from the constant need to win my parents' approval as well as the fear that I would be beaten if I got in trouble.

Would they believe me? All of these things weighing on a 9 year old was a lot so I didn't say anything and just tried to forget it happened. 

In high school I got bullied by teachers at this school I went to. For example, some of my classmates goofed around and somehow I got the blame for not telling on them. Of course I was too scared to go home and tell because I'm sure I would've been told it's my fault. I really was a good student, got along with all my peers, and made some amazing friends whom I'm in touch with still. 

A lot later in life my parents wanted me to get married so I did. My husband is a great guy but his mother is an absolute asshole and our relationship starts to break because of it. I had severe depression and had her constantly picking away at me even more after we have our first baby. We are now on a very low contact basis with her and have moved out.

I understand that his teeth are itchy, but he has a ton of toys he could bite. I however have no problems taking him out on walks and whatnot. 

I'm also a naturally messy person, so having a dog and having to keep my room clean at all times is really annoying for me. I am also suspecting that I might have ADD because I have a really hard time cleaning/going to school/and really doing anything even slightly time consuming.

4. Someone may empathize with feeling like their grief isn't valid or like they're not ""allowed"" to grieve because of their age or distance from the person who passed away.

There's no bitterness or spite or taking bad moods out to anyone, he's just as interested as I am about making a nice home we'll both enjoy. It's become a habit for both of us to just go express affection as a sign of being in a good mood, for something completely unrelated. The apartment is small so I can stop to kiss him on my way to the fridge and back, we can kiss while hanging up laundry, and hold hands while running boring errands and getting groceries. I can make him laugh. 

Today he laid down on the bed for a while to get a break from sitting while gaming. So I went to kiss him, and as I got up, I took off his left sock and took it with me. He was so baffled that I'd do something like that for literally no reason that he started laughing, and his laughter is sunshine.

I can make him laugh. <br><br>Today he laid down on the bed for a while to get a break from sitting while gaming. So I went to kiss him, and as I got up, I took off his left sock and took it with me. He was so baffled that I'd do something like that for literally no reason that he started laughing, and his laughter is sunshine. <br><br>Today we're taking my old, broken table to recycling, it was replaced by the nice, prettier, sturdy table his parents bought for us.

203,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"I grew up playing an all-girls' sport. I never was really friends with the other girls because they were always talking about boys and makeup and drama while I was always more focused on my grades, college, or reading.I didn't dislike any of them, just always felt out of the loop and disconnected. I was homeschooled so my only interaction with other people my age was these eight or so girls who hung out all the time and never invited me. They weren't always trying to be mean but they were always closer with each other because they shared common interests. 

I would try to not let it get to me, but it always hurt that everyone seemed to always have someone to talk to and I had nobody. My mom always told me I would find my group eventually and it would just make the friendship that much more valuable. 

Well, I finally found my group. It's a strange friend group but I feel connected. And on top of that, I actually have a best friend! I started a new sport last year and found I had a lot more in common with my training partners. Granted, most of them are a good ten to twenty years older than I am but we're all really close and talk a lot. 

I also have someone to call my best friend! I never would have imagined someone like her actually being friends with me. She likes dressing up and going out, is extroverted, optimistic, a go with the flow kind of person, and isn't super competitive. I, on the other hand, hate shopping/dressing up, view myself as a nerd, am a little more negative, feel the need to plan everything down to the minute, and am super competitive to the point where I spend all my free time training. She also is a very touchy-feely person, whereas I am not so much. 

Recently, we became very close to the point where she will sometimes refuse to go places with the rest of the friend group if I'm not able to go because she feels closer to me than the others. The other day, she mentioned that she got me something small for my birthday and I am so happy. She actually remembered my birthday after I only mentioned it once and, as if just remembering it weren't enough, felt the need to get me something. 

I cannot believe how lucky I am to have found someone who values me as a person and the friendship doesn't feel one sided!","I grew up playing an all-girls' sport.

208,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"I am a medical technology student and we are studying phlebotomy this semester. My hometown is in a province but I moved to the city to study college. I don't have friends in the city and university. I also live alone. My classmates were able to practice drawing blood from their friends and roommates. I cannot practice because I do not have anyone to practice with. 

I was able to talk with 4 of my classmates but they have already known each other for years so I'm a bit left out of the group. Earlier was our practical in drawing blood. It's like a demo and it's also graded. I was nervous but I remained calm. My partner drew blood from me first and she was shaking out of nervousness! Fortunately, she was able to draw blood from me. 

When I was going to draw blood from her, I was surprisingly calm. I was not shaking. At first, I was not able to get the blood so I moved the needle slightly and saw the backflow of blood! I was so happy! It was the first time I drew blood! Although, my professor deducted points because I did not fill up my syringe even though I could. But still, I'm very happy because I was able to draw blood without practice and only watching my classmates do it. 

If I told this to my mom, she will also be very happy!","I am a medical technology student and we are studying phlebotomy this semester.

209,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"I suffer from major depressive disorder (and about half a dozen other DSM-V diagnoses) and I hesitated for years to get another pet because I was worried I couldn't provide the kind of care and attention they need and deserve. 

Then the pandemic came. With the freedom of being fortunate enough to work from home, I felt like I had a choice to either use my newfound free time to accelerate my self-destruction through isolation and substance abuse (which I absolutely did for the first few months of quarantine) or find a way to actually improve my life -- and that's what I've done my best to work toward for the last year. 

I moved out of my parents' house at an embarrassingly late age and bought one of my own, something I'm incredibly proud of and was very lucky to have been able to do. I got back into therapy and decided to try some new medications with as much patience as I could muster. I started taking a bit better care of myself physically and spending more time around people, especially my handful of good friends. 

Feeling better about myself than I have in a while, I finally ran out of excuses not to go through with the adoption and went to the local humane society. I met a dozen or so dogs but there was only one I felt an immediate connection to and I took her home that day. 

She was nervous at first in her new environment and didn't even want to join me on the couch but, after a couple days of realizing I wouldn't ever leave her, she was already sleeping on my lap. She follows me everywhere and loves to play and cuddle. She had a play date with a friend's dog yesterday and she had so much fun that she's still exhausted. Plus she gets me moving which I desperately needed! 

As a depressed person who also feels like he can give a rescue a happy life, I'm confident it's one of the best decisions I've ever made. I am genuinely happy for the first time in at least a decade when I'm around her and worry constantly when I occasionally can't be. 

I can't wait to travel again now that this viral nightmare has finally began to wind down and I'm so looking forward to taking her with me.","I suffer from major depressive disorder (and about half a dozen other DSM-V diagnoses) and I hesitated for years to get another pet because I was worried I couldn't provide the kind of care and attention they need and deserve. <br><br>Then the pandemic came.

I have been quite lonely for what feels like most of my entire life, but I was lucky enough to meet this guy in one of my classes a couple of weeks or so ago who is very nice and actually seems to have some sort of interest in me. We've especially been talking more this week, and I was so happy because he asked for my number a couple days ago. 

Today when we were talking towards the end of class, though, I had mentioned that a couple things I really like are photography and hiking. One thing he asked was about which trail was my favorite, and when I told him, he said he really liked that one too because it was pretty close and he enjoyed going mountain biking there. Eventually, he said that he would love to take me there this weekend, because I had mentioned that I didn't really have any plans. I said that sounded like it would be super fun and that I'd be happy to go with him, and by the end of our chat, he said he would call me later so we could work out our plans. 

Fast forward to when I was at home, and I was so nervous once again for when he would call me because it's actually our first time talking on the phone and doing something outside of school.

I am currently the global inclusion program manager for our diverse engagement team, and I am hired to make sure people have a sense of belonging. It's so fun because in this space and this work it's all about behavior change, and that takes some time. 

But when you see people's behavior changed because of something they didn't know, that they now know, that transformed their life. That's the only thing I need at night, that makes me super happy. 

So be open to opportunities, and know that your mind may change. What won't change is inherently what's inside you. Or what you feel like you were destined here to do.","From my time in high school, I knew intimately what it felt like to be left out and not have a voice. And I said, you know what?
